FlySSH
</h1>

<p align="center">A cross platform SSH client</p>


### Why?

I made this to learn about AES encryption and also because I don't wanna pay for Termius's pro plan just to sync my ssh hosts and keys.


### Features

- Syncs your hosts and Keys
- Keys and Hosts are AES 256 encrypted
- Encryption and Decryption happens on your device, plain text never leaves your device.


### Roadmap
- SFTP implementation
- Split Screen for hosts
- SSH Tunneling

### Tech Used

- Flutter
- Nestjs
- Prisma
- Postgresql
